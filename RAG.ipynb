Their aim was to establish an independent organization that focuses on delivering emergency medicine aid quickly, effectively and impartially.\\n\\nMSF is a private international association. The association is made up mainly of doctors and health sector workers and is also open to all other professions which might help in achieving its aims.\\n\\nThree hundred volunteers made up the organization when it was founded: doctors, nurses and other staff, including the 13 founding doctors and journalists. Today, MSF is a worldwide movement of over 69,000 people.\\n\\nWho we are?\\n\\nWhere do we Work?\\n\\nIn more than 70 countries, Médecins Sans Frontières provides medical humanitarian assistance to save lives and ease the suffering of people in crisis situations.\\n\\nFull list of countries\\n\\nLE MEDECINS SANS FRONTIERES ARZTE OHNE GRENZEN eV.\\n\\nABOUT MSF\\n\\nMSF was created in the belief that all people should have access to healthcare regardless of gender, race, religion, creed or political affiliation, and that people’s medical needs outweigh respect for national boundaries.

The agenda includes introductions of team members, an overview of MSF and its fundraising loyalty management, project scope, cadence, next steps, and a Q&A session. MSF, founded in 1971, is an international humanitarian organization focused on providing medical aid in crisis situations, operating in over 70 countries with a commitment to healthcare access for all. The project team consists of members from both MSF and ESMT, with various roles outlined for each individual.',\n",

Data for this initiative will be shared with team members on January 14, 2025, and further data will be provided in batches at the end of January or early February.
